Differences with C version:

 - Parser stack is always dynamic (grows automatically).
 - Debug is always enabled, possibly 'const debug' will be added in future for
   dead code elimination.
 - Instead of a union for YYMINORTYPE, I use interface{}.
 - Default type for a token minor is interface{} (TODO(nsf): why? maybe change to int).
 - YYTRACKMAXSTACKDEPTH is not implemented and removed from the source code.
 - Custom Parser arguments are not implemented (yet).
